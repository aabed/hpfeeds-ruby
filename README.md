# HPFeeds

This gem should be used to make easy to interact (publish, subscribe) with a [HPFeeds broker](https://redmine.honeynet.org/projects/hpfeeds/wiki).

At the moment it's just a gem naked skeleton, and an idea in my mind. Don't know how does it takes for me to write down something...

## Installation

    gem 'hpfeeds'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:
